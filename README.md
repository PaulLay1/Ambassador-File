# Ambassador-File

This project has been created as means of making management easier, and as an addition of myself (Paul Lay), learning how to code and program projects I can create from scratch.

Before you get into the coding, you will need an editor (preferably either Visual Studio Code aka. VS Code on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac OS) to edit and execute them, otherwise you'll get a blank webpage upon running.

Hence, that the file you see is merely a template.

If you have it downloaded onto such computers or laptops, it will become a simple HTML file, leading you to the launch of the browser when you easily click the file or icon on desktop.

To open up in editors like VS Code and TextEdit, right-click the HTML file, select "Open with", and select the aforementioned editiors from the dropdown menu.
